# GueneTh - Full Stack Web Application

This project is a Flask-based full-stack web application developed as a personal website. It features multiple sections including a blog, portfolio, and contact form. The site is designed to showcase various personal projects, such as a Y Combinator scraper, and aims to continuously grow with new projects and enhancements over time.

The site is live and accessible at www.gueneth.com.

Features

Portfolio
A dedicated space to showcase completed and ongoing projects. Projects like the Y Combinator scraper are described in detail, with the potential for new projects to be added as they are developed.

Blog
A blogging platform where insights, experiences, or updates on development projects are shared.

Scrape Y Combinator News
